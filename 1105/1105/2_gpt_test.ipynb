      "In a valley where evening settled like a soft blanket, there lived a unicorn named Lumi. Her horn shone like a drop of moonlight, and her hooves made hardly a sound on the mossy paths. Every night, Lumi walked to the silver lake to listen to the hush of the water and the whispering pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, a tiny star tumbled out of the sky and landed with a gentle plink in the reeds. It shivered, its glow flickering like a candle in a breeze. “I’ve lost my way,” the star said, small as a bell and shy as a firefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lumi lowered her head so the star could climb onto her mane. “Hold tight,” she said. “We’ll find your sky again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They set off along the lake, where the moon lay down like a coin on the water. “Goodnight,” hooted the owl, folding its wings. “Goodnight,” hummed the river, smoothing stones with its song. “Goodnight,” sighed the wind, combing the tall grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the highest hill, Lumi stood where the world felt nearest to the night. She breathed slowly, and her horn gathered the moon’s cool shine, the river’s song, the owl’s hush, and the wind’s sigh. The light braided itself into a soft, shimmering path that reached upward through the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Follow,” Lumi whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The star drifted along the luminous thread, growing brighter with each little heartbeat. Before it reached the sky, it paused and brushed Lumi’s horn in thanks, leaving a sprinkle of warm, sleepy sparkles that floated down like dandelion seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path faded, the night grew still, and the star found its place again—right where it had always belonged, twinkling kindly over the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lumi walked home under the watching glow, past the owl, the river, and the whispering grass. She curled beneath a willow with leaves like quiet hands and closed her eyes. The star kept its gentle watch; the moon kept its gentle time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodnight, owl. Goodnight, river. Goodnight, grass and willow. Goodnight, little listener. Rest now. The sky knows your dreams, and the night will hold them safe until morning.\n"
